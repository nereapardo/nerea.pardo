          Simple game with a recognizable character where your reflexes are
          tested. The player&apos;s mission is to collect as many bills as
          possible. But you must be cautious, because collecting 3 bills of 500â‚¬
          in a row will make you automatically lose for being too greedy.

        <p className="mb-4">
          This was my first project, and at that point, I only had learned HTML,
          CSS and Javascript, so my knowledge and possibilities were limited.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Inspired by a classic game I loved playing as a child (whac-a-mole), I
          decided to to take this challenge as an opportunity to practice with
          DOM manipulation.

      <Project image={moneyRainHand} title="Challenges">
        <p className="mb-4">
          The biggest challenges were managing the score and levels without
          having learned about asynchronous programming yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finding out one of my problems were related to event listeners,
          I finally solved the scoring system and came up with a different
          approach to increase game levels when the player had won.
