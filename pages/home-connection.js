          Web app developed to make the process of renting a house easier. This

          In the last few years I had to move quite often so I am kind of
          familiar with different housing search platforms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          On the other hand, I also had experienced the process of posting a
          house for rent and being contacted by possible tenants.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why I decided to develop a web app where landlords can easily
          post their houses and people can directly contact them without relying
          on the platform as an intermediary.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Nowadays around half of the website traffic is generated by mobile
          devices. Therefore it was really import to develop a user-friendly
          platform available for all devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest mistake was trying to create a design that met all devices
          needs at once. After failing at this task, I soon realized I should
          had put my efforts into designing different layouts based on different
          devices requirements.
