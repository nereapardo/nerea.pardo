          In the last few years I had to move quite often so I am kind of
          familiar with different housing search platforms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          On the other hand, I also had experienced the process of posting a
          house for rent and being contacted by possible tenants.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why I decided to develop a web app where landlords can easily
          post their houses and people can directly contact them without relying
          on the platform as an intermediary.
